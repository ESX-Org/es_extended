# irl_extended

In Real Life Extended (a.k.a. IRL_extended) is the primary roleplay framework. 

Featuring many extra resources to fit roleplaying, here's a taste of what's available:

- irl_ambulancejob: play as a medic to revive people who are bleeding out. Complete with garages and respawn & bleedout system. Early working and covid-19 danger expected.
- irl_policejob: patrol the city and arrest people commiting crime, with armory, outfit room and garages. You can also arrest people for not staying home.
- irl_vehicleshop: roleplay working in an vehicle dealership where you sell cars to people. Who need a car while in quarantine?

ESX was initially developed by God back in ages for humans as there wasn't any economy roleplaying frameworks available.
The original code was written within exactly 7 days and never open sourced, it has ever since been improved and parts been rewritten to further improve on it (no more dinosaurs, for example)
